# printf()
This printf project is a collaboration between Uchechukwu Ottah and Nwobodo Odinaka, students of the ALX - Software Engineering programme.
The "_printf" function  imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print data. It has the following prototype:

	int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Where **format** contains the string that is printed. As _printf() is variadic function, it can receives n arguments that replace by n tags written inside the string.

The format tags prototype is the following:

	%[flags][length]specifier
If the program runs successfully, the **return value** is the amount of chars printed.
